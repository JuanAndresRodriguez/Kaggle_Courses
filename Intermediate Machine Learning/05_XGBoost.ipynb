    "## Gradient Boosting\n",
    "Gradient boosting is a method that goes through cycles to iteratively add models into an ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "It begins by initializing the ensemble with a single model, whose predictions can be pretty naive. (Even if its predictions are wildly inaccurate, subsequent additions to the ensemble will address those errors.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we start the cycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, we use the current ensemble to generate predictions for each observation in the dataset. To make a prediction, we add the predictions from all models in the ensemble.\n",
    "- These predictions are used to calculate a loss function (like mean squared error, for instance).\n",
    "- Then, we use the loss function to fit a new model that will be added to the ensemble. Specifically, we determine model parameters so that adding this new model to the ensemble will reduce the loss. (Side note: The \"gradient\" in \"gradient boosting\" refers to the fact that we'll use gradient descent on the loss function to determine the parameters in this new model.)\n",
    "- Finally, we add the new model to ensemble, and ...\n",
    "- ... repeat!"
