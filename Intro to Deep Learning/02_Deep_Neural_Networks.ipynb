Through a deep stack of layers, a neural network can transform its inputs in more and more complex ways. In a well-trained neural network, each layer is a transformation getting us a little bit closer to a solution.\n",

    "### Many Kinds of Layers\n",
    "A \"layer\" in Keras is a very general kind of thing. A layer can be, essentially, any kind of data transformation. Many layers, like the convolutional and recurrent layers, transform data through use of neurons and differ primarily in the pattern of connections they form. Others though are used for feature engineering or just simple arithmetic. "

    "When we attach the rectifier to a linear unit, we get a rectified linear unit or ReLU. (For this reason, it's common to call the rectifier function the \"ReLU function\".) Applying a ReLU activation to a linear unit means the output becomes max(0, w * x + b)"

That makes this network appropriate to a regression task, where we are trying to predict some arbitrary numeric value.
